This work includes two projects, one as a final term exam and a final lab exercise.

## Final Term Exam

Studied, Implemented and Extended the work [^1] in MATLAB

## Final Lab Exercise

Designed and Implemented a Controller for a three-wheeled omnidirectional robot to satisfy a given Signal Temporal Logic Specification (STL) in simulation and real-world. The implemented controller is inspired from [^2] and [^3]
