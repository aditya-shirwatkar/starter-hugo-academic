I've been interested in math and physics since I was in elementary school. Thanks to my awesome [peer group](https://www.ivlabs.in/) during undergrad, I gradually started to get into  robotics research. 
After years of adventure, I realized that I enjoy seeing my robots generate dynamic motions. This enjoyment has led to my current research interests in the intersection of **Motion Generation** and **Legged Robotics**.


To pursue this, I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/). I primarily do my research here on using **Optimal Control** and **Reinforcement Learning** techniques for the locomotion of legged robots in different environments.
