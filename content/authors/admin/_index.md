Since elementary school, I've been interested in math and physics. Thanks to my awesome [research group](https://www.ivlabs.in/) led by [Dr. Shital S. Chiddarwar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shital-chiddarwar-ph-d-5a7173b6) during undergrad at VNIT Nagpur, I had the opportunity to explore different areas in robotics. 

After years of adventure, I realized that I enjoyed seeing my robots generate dynamic motions and studying the mathematical beauty of their nonlinear dynamics. This enjoyment has led me to my research interests in **Motion Planning and Control**.

Currently I'm doing my PhD under [Prof. Shishir N. Y.](https://www.shishirny.com/) at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/).

Feel free to contact me for any questions or suggestions, I would be more than happy to interact through a chat or a meet.

Besides this, I like to spend my time [drawing](drawing/all) and looking at trees and clouds :)
